# Movie Webpage
This is the code for the first project in the **Full Stack NanoDegree**
for [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com).
This project builds a webpage featuring movies I have seen in 2017. The movie posters and links to the trailers are shown.


## Contents
The project consists of 3 files:
* entertainment_center.py - launches the program. It contains the movies and there information using an object of type `movie`.

* fresh_tomatoes.py - receives the `movie` objects and builds an html file.

* media.py - contains the code for the class `movie`. The `movie` class contains 6 properties and one method to access the trailer url.
